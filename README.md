It is a Circuit design and analysis project. The aim of this project is to design a 48V LED lamp and its driver. 
First we should design a buck converter where the input is 48v and the output is 10v. Next i have modified the basic buck converter circuit such as the input can be given any voltage range but the output is fixed to 10v. 
I have also provided the buck converter circuit using npn transistor which drives the mosfet gate instead using gate driver IC. I have constructed the whole circuit using dicrete components only ( NO IC's).
Next we should design a constant current led driver.
Add potentiometer for controlling the brightness of a led and switch to on and off the led.
Integrate arduino microcontroller for smart controls such as patterns,colours etc..
